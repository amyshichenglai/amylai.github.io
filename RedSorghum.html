                                Mo Yan’s novel Red Sorghum depicts the glorious history of Gaomi Township during the Japanese invasion. The novel is narrated by a descendant of the novel’s protagonists, who attempts to create a vivid depiction of Gaomi Township. However, the limitation of conventional descriptions inhibits the narrator from accurately portraying the intricacy of Gaomi. Throughout the novel, the narrator frequently employs paradoxes to display the complexity of Gaomi Township, and hyperbole to exhibit the inexpressible glory of the era. The use of these literary elements emphasizes that human experiences cannot be replicated through words. More importantly, it expands the readers’ understanding of a reality that is outside of their beliefs and experiences. This is especially crucial since individuals’ perspectives of the past often deviate from the true historical events due to the emotions and details that are often lost through text. Through the use of paradox and hyperbole, Mo Yan demonstrates the inaccuracy of language, highlighting people’s inability to question and challenge presented truths.

                                Mo Yan does not want readers to fully trust the narration, not only because of the potential biases, but also because of the inaccuracy of language. He believes that men should not “utter only the words that others have spoken” (357) or “ [repeat] the words of still others” (357). These quotations reveal Mo Yan’s concern with the people of the current generation, who blindly believe in what they are taught by textbooks, teachers, and elders, and are slowly losing the ability to explore complex events and human nature beyond the information that they receive.

                                Throughout the novel, the narrator frequently employs paradoxes to illustrate the inadequacy of language to truly reflect human experience. The use of this literary element  enhances the veracity of the narrator’s depiction of Gaomi. At the beginning of the novel, the narrator describes his hometown as the “most beautiful and most repulsive, most unusual and most common, most sacred and most corrupt, most heroic and most bastardly” (4) place in the world. The use of superlatives to augment the paradoxes in this quotation conveys that the narrator carries intense and complex emotions for Gaomi, yet, these emotions cannot be communicated adequately. Gaomi’s history cannot be captured easily through words, and the narrator can only use a series of contrasting adjectives to illustrate its various aspects. Through the inaccuracy of language, Mo Yan accentuates the importance for humans to explore and experience the conditions rather than invest in the preconceived understandings that are based on others’ descriptions. The narrator, likewise, utilizes contradictory adjectives to open the “Dog Ways” section. It is stated that the history of mankind is filled with the “legends of dogs and memories of dogs, despicable dogs, respectable dogs, fearful dogs, pitiful dogs” (169). Here, the narrator compares mankind to dogs. Using the paradox of both “despicable”(169) and “respectable”(169), Mo Yan reveals the complexity of human history. The history of Gaomi is composed of the lives of various individuals. Each person plays an important role in the glorious history of Gaomi, yet, the narration does not embody everyone. Most characters in the novel can be generalized through the list of adjectives describing the dogs, and this reduces the vividness, accuracy and validity of the narrator’s portrayal of Gaomi’s history. From this, Mo Yan stresses the importance of exploring beyond the presented truth.

                            <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 20px; text-indent: 60px; line-height: 2.0; text-align: justify">
                                Additionally, Mo Yan illustrates the complexity of individuals through the use of paradoxical descriptions. This emphasizes the limitation of text since it is nearly impossible for one to fully understand a person through others’ descriptions; readers are encouraged to remain skeptical about the perspective of the narrator. This is evident as the narrator describes Nine Dreams Cao as “a complex individual for whom the words ‘good’ and ‘bad’ are woefully inadequate” (112). Here, Mo Yan reveals the complexity of Nine Dreams Cao, and the impracticality of narration to accurately portray a complex character. Similarly, the complexity of mankind is explored once again when Passion describes the Japanese soldier in a way that is paradoxical to common sense. In this scene, Passion describes that “only shame show[s] on [the Japanese soldier’s] face, and his lovely eyes [are] filled with the panic of a hunted rabbit...Second Grandma [feels] a rush of pity for him, as she recognize[s] his tortured look of self-loathing and shame” (324).  Amidst this gruesome scene, Mo Yan inserts a description of the Japanese soldier’s innocence. He diverges from the truth of history in order to portray the truth of human nature:  that in the midst of neverending evils, there remains a hint of vulnerability and human kindness. With the historical backdrop of the gore and the grotesque, Mo Yan chooses to insert this fictional depiction in order to remind the reader that mankind is neither purely wicked nor purely good. Though the events that the narrator describes cannot be confirmed as truth, the paradox here serves a purpose; it is not meant to mislead, but rather serve as a challenge to the reader’s preconceived notions. In sum, the complexity of individuals reiterates the inadequacy of language, and encourages readers to contemplate a different reality.

                            <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 20px; text-indent: 60px; line-height: 2.0; text-align: justify">
                                In Red Sorghum, Mo Yan also utilizes hyperbole to characterize the narrator’s ancestors, highlighting the inaccuracy and unreliability of words, which reinforces the importance of questioning presented truths. This is most evident through the characterization of Yu Zhanao. At the beginning of the novel, the narrator describes Yu Zhanao as “a man destined to become a legendary hero” (1). This direct characterization through hyperbole at the beginning of the novel compels the readers to believe that Yu Zhanao is a heroic figure who will protect and save the people of Gaomi. However, his actions and the corresponding outcomes challenge the narrator’s description and the reader’s preconceived depiction of him. For example, Yu Zhanao kidnaps the son of Nine Dreams Cao in order to take vengeance for the three hundred lashes with the shoe sole. His action displays his will to hurt innocent people in order to fulfill his selfish interest, opposing the reader’s preconceived understanding of a hero. Moreover, during the battle at JiaoPing Highway, Yu Zhanao fails to defeat the Japanese, to protect his army, and to protect Grandma. His weakness contradicts the image of a legendary figure. Through this contrast, Mo Yan emphasizes the inability of language to accurately describe an individual, and the importance for readers to challenge their preconceived notions of a person. A more in-depth understanding of a character can be gained through observing their behaviours rather than the description from the narrator, because the words and phrases that the narrator uses as direct characterization are often oversimplified and do not reflect the complexity of the individual.  The inadequacy of language can also be seen through the characterization of Passion during her death scene. The narrator describes Passion’s last words as “liberal, dignified and richly resilient, yet serene and firm” (357). However, the scene of Passion’s death diverges from these adjectives. Just before Passion’s death, she is described to have a “bewitching smile” (354) on her face, contrasting the narrator’s use of “dignified”. Additionally, the description of Passion’s death is hyperbolic:  strange and chaotic. It is announced that “when [Passion is] placed in the coffin she [is] still cursing and kicking the lid.” (356). Passion’s cursing and kicking contradict the narrator’s use of  “serene”(357), which confirms the narrator’s description as inaccurate. The narrator’s bias reiterates the significance of questioning and challenging one’s preconceived understanding of an individual. Altogether, the narrator’s use of hyperbole in characterization indicates the inaccuracy of language, especially when describing an individual.

                                Mo Yan’s novel, Red Sorghum, reveals the inadequacy of language through the use of paradox and hyperbole, accentuating the importance of exploring the emotions and values beneath the literal presentation. This is displayed through Mo Yan’s use of paradox in the depiction of the intricacies in Gaomi. Likewise, the paradoxes used to describe individuals highlight the inadequacy of language as it cannot encompass the complexity of human nature. The use of hyperbole establishes that conventional descriptions do not accurately portray the glorious memory of ancestors. Ultimately, the inadequacy of language reiterates the importance for one to explore beyond what is presented. Ultimately, Mo Yan’s concern about the inadequacy of language highlights the need for the reader to explore beyond reality, in order to enhance understanding.
