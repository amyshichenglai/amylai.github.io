                                An unreliable narrator is one who cannot be trusted. Either from ignorance or self-interest, this narrator speaks with a bias, makes mistakes, or even lies.

                                In Red Sorghum, Mo Yan uses history as a medium through which he is able to narrate his understanding of historical and social reality. 
                                Red Sorghum is less of a strict historical text, and much more of a man’s attempt to reconcile the stories of his ancestors, with the fantasies of his heart.
                                The stories told are those that have been passed through the mouths of many before reaching the ears of Mo Yan.
                                Yet, at times during the novel, Mo Yan appears to be so omnisciently present that the reader can only assume that it is Mo Yan’s voice which he shines through the stories of the dead. 
                                Mo Yan’s fantasies are chasing those of his ancestor’s. There are details, and thoughts of which he will never know. There are gaps in his knowledge of history, gaps that he inevitably fills with his own understanding. Thus, that which cannot be bridged historically, is bridged by the author himself, who undeniably feels a sense of inferiority to his ancestors. 
                                Thus there is a metafictional component to his text. There are so many times in which he “breaks the fourth wall” and one is left  pondering how much of what we read is the undiluted truth. 
                                In the Afterword of Red Sorghum, Mo Yan refers to his full length novel as “involving but a longer duration, a larger number of characters and more fabricated lies with some truth values” 
                                This is the deep rooted purpose of unreliable storytelling in the text. Mo Yan longs to use history to express his perception of his national character, and that of mankind in general. 
                                In his narration, the true and the untrue are intertwined, serving to speak of the past, and to the future.

                                Encourage readers to explore how much of the story is true by themselves. Mo Yan does not want readers to fully trust his perspective. He believes that men should not “utter only the words that others have spoken” (357) or “ [repeat] the words of still others” (357). He emphasizes the complexity of mankind and human events throughout the novel. The use of unreliable narration emphasizes the idea that there is no genuine trueness to the character of man.

                                Mo Yan takes up the role of an omniscient narrator here but the audience knows that Grandma could not have revealed to him what she was thinking. Even in the midst of a bloody battle, the readers are brought into a place of muted solemnity and begin to question what is real and what is fantasy in this story.
                                Here, Mo Yan expresses his own understandings and questions regarding what it is to die. He intertwines the true fates of his ancestors with his own questions concerning life and death.
                                Grandma’s thoughts as she dies can be seen as completely fictional and an example of Mo Yan’s unreliable narrative style, yet this is not what comes to the mind of the reader when going through this passage. 
                                Rather we are transported into our own pondering of the transition to death alongside Mo Yan’s own confusion concerning: “What is the correct path? What is goodness? What is evil?”
                                Mo Yan bridges the gap between what is true, and what is unknown with his own philosophical questioning. It is in the death of Grandma that Mo yan’s philosophical understandings, and misunderstandings are brought to life, truly enriching the scene.
                                It is simply due to the fact that fiction and history are often not spoken of in the same breath that his narration here, no matter how effective, must be acknowledged as unreliable. 
                            </p>
                            <br><br>

                                "As  Second  Grandma  picked  up  Little  Auntie's  padded  red  jacket,  she  looked  with  unconcealed  surprise  at  her daughter, who didn't have to be coaxed out of bed for a change. There were wrinkles on her face, her eyebrows sagged, and her mouth was drooping—suddenly she looked like a little old woman. Poor Second Grandma's heart constricted, and the red jacket felt as cold as ice”.
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 20px; text-indent: 60px; line-height: 2.0; text-align: justify">
                                This entire encounter between Second Grandma, Little Auntie and the soldiers is one of the more notably fictional moments in the text. 
                                We know the more straightforward facts, that little auntie dies and second grandma is violated, but no one can truly fill in the details that occured before these tragedies, thus we see Mo Yan’s fictional method of portraying these moments as purely intentional. 
                                Mo Yan purposefully adds a sense of true horror to the events that were about to transpire. This is a sense of horror we can imagine Mo Yan felt when hearing of this tragedy. He expresses his own perception of the events through the fictional components he inserts into historical truth. Thus he effectively plants himself in both the past and the present, awarding him the closeness to his ancestor’s he so desperately desires. 
                                There’s no way to confirm that this is how second grandma views her daughter, yet this portion of the text is placed quite fittingly, almost causing the reader to overlook the unreliability of the passage.
                            </p>
                            <br><br>
                            <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 20px; line-height: 2.0; text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;">
                                “Though she was only slightly frightened by their bayonets, her mother’s face terrified her”.
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 20px; text-indent: 60px; line-height: 2.0; text-align: justify">
                                Little Auntie does not live to express her emotions in this moment, in a way, Mo Yan must express them for her.
                                In theme with the horror portrayed in this scene, we see the feeling of terror (directed towards each other), shared by daughter and mother.
                                Why in one of these undefined moments of history, would Mo Yan choose to portray them as being terrified of each other? 
                                Since we are not able to ask the narrator himself, the answer to this question can only be found in our interpretation
                                Perhaps, through Second Grandma’s fear of her daughter the author meant to emphasize the alienating quality of impending danger. That the sense of foreboding that precedes devastation often causes us to become so internally present that we can only see the people around us through the eyes of our fear.
                                Perhaps, through Little Auntie’s fear of her mother, the author meant to portray her innocence and naivety. She was so young that she could not even comprehend the danger of their situation, making what happened to her that much more devastating
                                Perhaps Mo Yan meant neither of these things in the portrayal of their circumstance, this is the heart of the appeal of unreliable storytelling in the text. It forces us to ponder, to analyze and to formulate answers to the questions that characterize human existence.
                            </p>
                            <br><br>
                            <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 20px; line-height: 2.0; text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;">
                                “She longed desperately for Granddad, but she hated him too. When he came tomorrow, she’d have a good cry in front of him, then give him hell”.
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 20px; text-indent: 60px; line-height: 2.0; text-align: justify">
                                Again, there’s no way to confirm that this is what she felt, thus establishing the unreliability of this portion of the text.
                                Though seemingly insignificant, Mo Yan’s  fictional “filling in of the gaps” here also serves to express a deeper meaning
                                He portrays both the vulnerability and pride of not only Second Grandma, but humanity.
                                He expresses the duality in Second Grandma’s emotional response. The vulnerability in her nature seeks only to be comforted, while the pride of her nature seeks retribution. 
                                Here we see that even the smallest details in Mo Yan’s unreliable story-telling technique have a hidden significance.  
                            </p>
                            <br><br>
                            <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 20px; line-height: 2.0; text-align: justify; font-weight: bold;">
                                “The last one to mount Second Grandma was a short young soldier. Only shame showed on his face, and his lovely eyes were filled with the panic of a hunted rabbit…. Second Grandma felt a rush of pity for him, as she recognized his tortured look of self loathing and shame”
                            </p>
                            <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans'; font-size: 20px; text-indent: 60px; line-height: 2.0; text-align: justify">
                                One wonders why Mo Yan would, in the midst of such a gruesome scene, suggest that there was any innocence within the hearts of the Japanese soldiers.
                                Here, Mo Yan’s unreliable narration serves to portray his own understanding of social reality. 
                                He diverges from the truth of history in order to portray the truth of human nature, that in the midst of our neverending evils, there remains a hint of vulnerability and human kindness. 
                                On the historical backdrop of gore and grotesqueness, Mo Yan chooses to insert this fictional depiction in order to remind the reader that mankind is neither purely bad nor purely good. 
                                Though the events he describes cannot be confirmed as truth, his unreliability here serves a purpose, it is not entirely malintented or meant to “fool”, rather it serves as a challenge to the preconceived notions of the reader.
