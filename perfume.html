                                To love and to be loved are the basic rights of every human being. Ironically, as humans progress toward civilization, we have created a cage that has taken away our basic request of love and passion. The ideas of “morals” acts as a benchmark, separating every object and action into right or wrong. These assumptions made about legitimacy limits us from pursuing our true love and passion. Perfume: The Story of a Murderer, is a story of pursuit - the pursuit of survival, the pursuit of beauty and the pursuit of love. At the beginning of the story, Grenouille’s squall saves his own life and ultimately brings death upon his mother. This demonstrates how Grenouille is born to pursue his goals without morals.  Grenouille is on the edge of death numerous times. However, he survives the neglectful orphanage, anthrax at the tannery, and another disease at Baldini’s. These all demonstrates his pursuit of survival. During this pursuit, he also learns in a way that is similar to a trade. Everytime Grenouille interacts with a character, he always gains and gives off something. For example, at the orphanage, Grenouille receives the time to be alone and explore the scent world, and in return, Madame Gailliard gains money. Accumulating the knowledge from his acquaintances, he develops his second pursuit - the pursuit of beauty, or in his terms, pleasant aroma. It is for this pursuit he murders the plum girl. This murder scene is depicted by impersonal descriptions, conveying the idea that Grenouille’s action is not sinister or immoral, it is merely an expression of passion. In fact, here, we can detect the amoral nature of Grenouille. Throughout childhood, no one teaches Grenouille of morals. Hence, he does not feel guilty for the murder. And it is his amoral nature that allows him to overlook societal judgement and solely focus on completing his goals.  Slowly, Grenouille discovers that his ultimate pursuit is love. For this pursuit, he murders twenty-five virgin girls and uses their odors to invent the most divine and manipulative perfume. This is when the collision between societal judgement and personal passion culminates. Are the murders justifiable? We all know that murder is inhumane, but Grenouille did nothing more than express unruly human passion. Though, the amoral Grenouille did not ponder upon these paradoxical facts. He continues on with his pursuits. His perfume makes others loyal to him and love him. Everyone who is exposed to the perfume falls into the illusions that Grenouille is their love, their God, and their everything. Yet, Grenouille, is sober. He knows that people do not truly love him. They are simply manipulated by the perfume. Even worse, he discovers that he loathes all mankind because no one understands him. Even Richis is fooled by his perfume. Grenouille’s egotism pushes him into despair. His ultimate pursuit for love has failed. He cannot receive or give true love. His life came to an aimless end.
